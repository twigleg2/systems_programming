# Part1:
1.
It shows the name of the program and it's pid, then sleeps for 30 seconds.
2.
the final print statement will execute if given an invalid program as a parameter

# Part 2:
3.
coins@Thicket:~/CS324/hw3$ ./exec /bin/cat
Program "./exec" has pid 255. Sleeping.
Running exec of "/bin/cat"
4.
coins@Thicket:~/CS324/hw3$ ps -p 255 -o "user pid ppid state ucmd"
USER       PID  PPID S CMD
coins      255   215 S exec
coins@Thicket:~/CS324/hw3$ ps -p 255 -o "user pid ppid state ucmd"
USER       PID  PPID S CMD
coins      255   215 S cat
5.
They are the same with one exception.  the command name has changed, because execve launched a new command gave the first programs pid to it.
6.
coins@Thicket:~/CS324/hw3$ ./exec fakeProgram
Program "./exec" has pid 259. Sleeping.
Running exec of "fakeProgram"
End of program "./exec".

# Part 3:
7.
Prints process ID, creates a fork, then parent/child have their own branches to execute, with a shared section again at the end.
8.
Both run section A
Child runs section B
Parent runs section C
Neither runs section D

# Part 4:
9.
coins@Thicket:~/CS324/hw3$ ./fork
Starting program; process has pid 293
Section A;  pid 293
Section A;  pid 294
Section C
Section B
Section B done sleeping
Section C done sleeping
coins@Thicket:~/CS324/hw3$ ps -C fork -o "user pid ppid state ucmd" --forest
USER       PID  PPID S CMD
coins      293   215 S fork
coins      294   293 S  \_ fork
coins@Thicket:~/CS324/hw3$ ps -C fork -o "user pid ppid state ucmd" --forest
USER       PID  PPID S CMD
coins      293   215 S fork
coins      294   293 Z  \_ fork <defunct>
10.
they are the same, except the child is a zombie because it ends before the parent
11.
wait(NULL);
It feels most efficient to put it between the two sleep calls in section C, but it could go mostly anywhere.
12.
Starting program; process has pid 11055
Section A;  pid 11055
Section A;  pid 11056
Section B
Section C
Section C done sleeping
coins@Thicket:~/CS324/hw3$ ps -C fork -o "user pid ppid state ucmd" --forest
USER       PID  PPID S CMD
coins    11055   215 S fork
coins    11056 11055 S  \_ fork
coins@Thicket:~/CS324/hw3$ ps -C fork -o "user pid ppid state ucmd" --forest
USER       PID  PPID S CMD
coins    11056     1 S fork
13.
The parent process ended and made the child process an orphan.  The child got a new ppid as a result.

# Part 5:
14.
I ran it multiple times and got two results -
coins@Thicket:~/CS324/hw3$ ./fork
coins@Thicket:~/CS324/hw3$ cat fork-output.txt
BEFORE FORK
SECTION A
SECTION C
SECTION A
SECTION B
coins@Thicket:~/CS324/hw3$ ./fork
coins@Thicket:~/CS324/hw3$ cat fork-output.txt
BEFORE FORK
SECTION A
SECTION A
SECTION C
SECTION B
15.
Here you can clearly see the scheduler taking over and letting the processes run in no particular order.
16.
coins@Thicket:~/CS324/hw3$ ./fork
Hello from section B

# Part 6:
17.
